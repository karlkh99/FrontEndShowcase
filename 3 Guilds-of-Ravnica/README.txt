This project is original to me and inspired to w3schools how to site tabs.
(https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tabs.asp)
Though this project is half-finished, it's can be understood from navigating the site.
This project showcases my ability to implement javascript,
and it showcases my ability to create my own project, experimenting with a different website structure.
